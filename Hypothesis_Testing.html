<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Hypothesis Testing</h1>
<h4 class="author">James Van Slyke</h4>

</div>


<div id="populations-and-samples" class="section level3">
<h3>Populations and Samples</h3>
<p>So far, we’ve primarily dealt with <em>descriptive statistics</em>,
which are used to describe the basics of a dataset (think central
tendency and variability). However, most of psychological science is
running experiments and testing hypotheses. When psychologists run an
experiment, they use a <em>sample</em>, which is a smaller subgroup of
the population (the larger group) they are trying to explain. Most
experiments are run on samples, which serve as an estimation of some
property of the population that a scientist is attempting to
explain.</p>
<p>For example, if a psychologist is interested in gender differences,
the populations would be either all females or all males (That’s a large
group of people!). So to run an experiment, psychologists instead use a
sample (smaller subgroup) of males and a sample of females to compare
them based on some particular variable.</p>
<p>The process of using a sample to infer characteristics about a
population is called <em>inferential statistics</em>. Many of the
statistics used to analyze experiments are inferential statistics of one
kind or another.</p>
</div>
<div id="hypotheses" class="section level3">
<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<p>A good experiment begins with a good hypothesis, which clearly
specifies the variables in an experiment. There are two types of
variables in most experiments:</p>
<p>1. Independent Variable (IV)</p>
<p>2. Dependent Variable (DV)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The independent variable is the variable that is manipulated in some
way and is thought to be the cause in the experiment, while the
dependent variable is measured to assess whether the independent
variable produces any changes in it, so it is thought to be the effect
in an experiment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The hypothesis specifies the relationship between the IV and the DV.
In statistics, there are two types of hypotheses, the <em>null
hypothesis</em> and the <em>alternative hypothesis</em>. The null
hypothesis negates or contradicts the expected relationship between the
IV and DV if the IV has a real effect. The alternative hypothesis
specifies the relationship between the IV and DV as the experimenter
expects it to be, the IV causing a change in the DV.</p>
<p>In experimental methodology, the <em>null</em> hypothesis is directly
tested and if it can be shown to be <em>unsupported</em> (based on the
statistical analysis), it then lends support to its counterpart, the
alternative hypothesis.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you work for a gasoline company and you’ve
developed a new additive that you believe increases gas mileage. Your
supervisor would like to add it to their gasoline, but feels that it’s
important to run a test first to see if the additive really increases
gas mileage. So you collect a sample of 75 cars that are all using the
gasoline additive. You discover that the mean gas mileage for your
sample is 26.5 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Here are the two hypotheses for the gasoline additive example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Null hypothesis - “The gasoline additive will <em>not</em> increase
the mileage of the gasoline”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternative Hypothesis - “The gasoline additive will increase the
mileage of the gasoline”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the hypotheses are basically exactly the same, except
that the null hypothesis <em>negates</em> the relationship between the
IV and DV. A good hypothesis will include both the IV and DV and
something to specify the expected outcome of the experiment. In this
case the word “increases” shows the relationship between the two
variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="directional-or-nondirectional" class="section level3">
<h3>Directional or Nondirectional?</h3>
<p>This is an example of a <em>directional</em> hypothesis because it’s
specifying the direction of the expected effect of the IV. A
nondirectional hypothesis does not specify the direction, it just states
that the IV will have an <em>effect</em> on the DV. Here’s how gasoline
mileage hypotheses would look like as <em>non</em>directional
hypothesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Null hypothesis - “The gasoline additive will <em>not</em> effect the
mileage of the gasoline”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternative Hypothesis - “The gasoline additive will effect the
mileage of the gasoline”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the only real difference is that the word “increase” was
swapped with the word “effect”. Whether the hypothesis is directional or
nondirectional is usually determined by the experimenter or the context
of the experiment.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img

<p class="caption">Nondirectional vs. Directional tests</p>
</div>
<p>Image from <a
href="https://towardsdatascience.com/hypothesis-testing-z-scores-337fb06e26ab"
class="uri">https://towardsdatascience.com/hypothesis-testing-z-scores-337fb06e26ab</a></p>
<p>Directional tests are one-tailed (evaluate only one tail of the
distribution) because they are investigating a specific direction of
effect for the IV (e.g. increasing) while nondirectional tests are
two-tailed (evaluate both tails of the distribution) because they are
not specifying the direction of effect for IV.</p>
<p>Basic scientific methodology requires an experimental and a control
group. The experimental group receives the IV while the control group
does not. If a difference between the groups can be detected then that
difference may be attributable to the IV. If there is no difference
between the groups the IV does not have an effect.</p>
<p>Another way to state this is that the null hypothesis assumes that
there is no difference between the control and experimental groups (the
groups or equal), while the alternative hypothesis assumes that there
will be a difference between the groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Null hypothesis - experimental group = control group</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternative Hypothesis - experimental group <span
class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> control group</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The null hypothesis is tested to answer the question are these
results due to chance? Different statistical tests use different
probability distributions to analyze the results of an experiment. The
probability distributions allow us to see what is the probability
associated with the results we obtained in our experiment. The
probability that is shown through the probability distribution is
compared to <em>alpha</em>. Alpha is an accepted scientific standard for
determining the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis. Alpha is
equal to .05 or 5%. So the standard that is accepted by the scientific
community is that there is only a 5% chance or less that the findings in
the experiment conducted are the result of chance alone. <span
class="math display">\[
\alpha = .05
\]</span> The probability associated with the outcome of our experiment
based on a probability distribution is known as the <em>p</em> value
(<em>p</em> standing for probability)</p>
</div>
<div id="basic-statistical-formula" class="section level3">
<h3>Basic Statistical Formula</h3>
<p>A really easy way to understand how most statistical outputs are
generated is to understand this simple formula. <span
class="math display">\[
\frac{signal}{noise}
\]</span> Signal refers to what is known as systematic variation or
variation that is introduced by an experiment. In the gasoline example,
the additive that is supposed to increase gas mileage is systematic
variation. The gasoline is being manipulated to try to increase gas
mileage through the use of the additive. The more increase in gas
mileage associated with the additive, the stronger the signal and the
more likely the independent variable (in this case the additive) has a
real effect.</p>
<p>Noise is like background noise or variation that exists, but wasn’t
introduced through the experimental manipulation. This is often referred
to as unsystematic variation. This is variation that exists for a
variety of reasons. Going back to our gasoline mileage example,
unsystematic variation could be differences in the cars used,
differences in the road conditions or differences in the weather.
Experimentors try to minimize this type of variation as much as
possible, but there is always a certain amount of unsystematic
variation</p>
<p>One potential form of unsystematic variation is <em>measurement
error</em>. For example, imagine that you weigh yourself every day for a
whole week. Most likely there will be fluctuations in your weight during
the week. It will be slightly higher one day and slightly lower another
day with an average or mean that stays more consistent. Measurement
error exists in any variable that we are attempting to measure. It is
unavoidable to a certain extent because whatever we are attempting to
measure, there will be certain fluctuations in the precision of
measurement. Going back to our original formula, measurement error is
our estimation of noise and although experiments are always trying to
minimize error a certain amount will always be present. So another way
to understand our primary formula is <span class="math display">\[
statistics = \frac{experimental\;manipulation}{measurement\;error}
\]</span></p>
</div>
<div id="confidence-intervals" class="section level3">
<h3>Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>One statistic to help analyze measurement error is called a
<em>confidence interval</em>. A confidence interval is an interval of
numbers between which we are 95% confident that the population mean is
contained when drawn from a sample. According to Morling (2021) a
confidence interval is composed of 3 components.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Variability component - this is most often the standard deviation
<em>sd</em> (remember that the <em>sd</em> if one of our basic measures
of dispersion or variability)</li>
<li>Sample size component - Usually this will be a calculation involving
the number in the sample, most often symbolized by <em>n</em>.</li>
<li>Constant associated with 95% - Here we’ll use the z score associated
with 95 percent</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the basic formula for a confidence interval using z
scores.</p>
<p>lower boundary of CI - <span class="math inline">\(\bar X -
1.96\)</span> x <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span></p>
<p>upper boundary of CI - <span class="math inline">\(\bar X +
1.96\)</span> x <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\)</span> is known as
the standard error of the mean and is the standard deviation divided by
the square root of the number in the sample. 1.96 is the z score
associated with the 95% percentile, thus, the 95% confidence
interval.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>Let’s imagine we have a sample of persons aged 40 to 50 who were
trying to run on a treadmill at it’s fastest speed. This is a sample of
times in seconds they were able to maintain a sprint at the treadmill’s
fastest speed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sprint &lt;- c(18, 16, 18, 24, 23, 22, 22, 23, 26, 29, 32, 34, 34, 36, 36, 43, 42, 49, 46, 46, 57)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can find the mean and standard deviation for this group of
scores</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sprint_mean &lt;- mean(sprint)
sprint_sd &lt;- sd(sprint)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use these scores to find the 95% confidence interval</p>
<pre class="r"><code>lower &lt;- sprint_mean - 1.96*sprint_sd/sqrt(21)
upper &lt;- sprint_mean + 1.96*sprint_sd/sqrt(21)
lower</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 27.23457</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>upper</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 37.14638</code></pre>
<p>Based on this sample, we are 95% confident that the mean time for the
population of 40 to 50-year-olds to sprint on the treadmill at its top
speed is between 27.23 and 37.15 seconds.</p>
