This is the website for Students at Fresno Pacific University to learn about statistics using R Studio. 

Examples and content are for anyone interested in learning how to use statistics, but they are especially for Psychology 300 Statistics and Psy 315 Advanced Research Methods taught by Dr. James A. Van Slyke

There are two books used to help teach this content. Both are free and online.

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html)
- [Learning statistics with R: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/book/)

This site is also based on examples from books I've used in the past, which continue to be excellent resources for learning statistics.

- Salkind, N. J. & Shaw, L. A. (2019). *Statistics for people who (think they) hate statistics using R.* Sage. 
- Pagano, R. R. (2012). *Understanding Statistics in the behavioral sciences* (10th ed.). Cengage.
