The variability between the groups $SS_{between}$ and the variability within the groups $SS_{within}$. Remember that the variability between the groups needed to be *greater* than the variability within the groups because that would indicate that the difference between the groups was greater than the measurement error that existed within the groups.\n\n#### Main Effects\n\nTwo-way ANOVA goes beyond one-way ANOVA by analyzing the effects of two independent variables in the same experiment. In a two-way ANOVA the two independent variables are called *main effects* or *factors* and each main effect has its own individual hypothesis.\n\n#### Interaction effects\n\nFinally, the two-way ANOVA analyzes if there is an *interaction effect* between the two main effects or factors. An interaction effect occurs when the effect of one of the independent variables is not the same at all levels of the second independent variable. So the set up for a two-way ANOVA is:\n\n-   Independent variable 1 = Main effect 1 = Factor 1\n\n-   Independent variable 2 = Main effect 2 = Factor 2\n\n-   Interaction effect = Interaction between Factors 1 & 2\n\n#### Two-Way ANOVA Example\n\nThe example dataset tests what's called the \"beer googles effect\". Sometimes alcohol can have an effect on perceptions of attraction for potential dates, especially later in the evening at bars. The dataset tests whether perceptions of attractiveness change after drinking alcohol and whether males and females are effected by this phenomenon differently.\n\n##### Variables\n\nTwo Independent Variables (Main Effects or Factors)\n\n-   Main Effect 1 = Alcohol 3 Levels (None, 2 Pints, 4 Pints)\n-   Main Effect 2 = Gender 2 Levels (Male and Female)\n-   Interaction Effect = Gender x Alcohol\n-   DV = Attractiveness of the partner selected at the end of the evening\n\nAlternative Hypotheses\n\n-   $H_1$ Alcohol has an effect on the attractiveness level of the selected partner\n-   $H_2$ Gender has an effect on the attractiveness level of the partner.\n-   $H_3$ There is an interaction effect between Alcohol and Gender\n\nSum of Squares variation estimates\n\n### Fixing the Variables\n\nGet the dataset and import it\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nlibrary(haven)\ngoggles <- read_sav(\"goggles.sav\")\n```\n\nCheck out Gender variable\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles$Gender\n```\n\nCheck out Alcohol variable\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles$Alcohol\n```\n\nCheck out Attractiveness variable\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles$Attractiveness\n```\n\nAlcohol and Gender variables are factors. When they get imported from SPSS they don't function as well because the focus is on the numbers, not the labels or words.We can use tidyverse and the mutate function to fix this.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles <- goggles %>% \n  mutate(Gender = factor(Gender, levels = c(0,1), \n         labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")))\n```\n\nWe can do the same thing with the Alcohol variable. Make sure you know the levels or numbering of the variable\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles$Alcohol\n```\n\nThen go ahead and mutate the variable as you did with Gender\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\ngoggles <- goggles %>% \n  mutate(Alcohol = factor(Alcohol, levels = c(1,2,3), \n            labels = c(\"None\", \"2 Pints\", \"4 Pints\")))\n```\n\n#### Running Two-Way ANOVA in R Studio\n\nNow we can move to the Two-Way ANOVA analysis. \"m3\" is the new object to save results so the formula will have this structure.\n\n> \\# m3 \\<- aov (this is the computation you are using, like t.test) Then the rest of your formula should look like this (Dependent variable \\~ Varible 1 + Variable 2 + Variable 1\\*Variable 2, data = \\[your dataset\\])\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nm3 <- aov(Attractiveness ~ Gender + Alcohol + \n           Gender*Alcohol, data = goggles)\n```\n\nCheck the results\n\n```{r}\nsummary(m3)\n```\n\nKey Findings from our output\\\nMain effect of Alcohol on attractiveness\\\nInteraction effect of Alcohol and Gender\\\n*What does this mean?*\n\n### Graphs for the Main Effects\n\nLet's use a graph to understand this better\\\nFirst let's look at each variable individually\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nGogglesAlcohol <- goggles %>%\n  group_by(Alcohol) %>%\n  summarize(n = n(),\n            mean = mean(Attractiveness),\n            sd = sd(Attractiveness),\n            se = sd/sqrt(n),\n            ci = qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd / sqrt(n))\n```\n\nGraph the Alcohol variable individually\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nggplot(GogglesAlcohol, aes(x = Alcohol,\n                                y = mean)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin  =mean - ci, \n                    ymax = mean + ci), \n                width = .1)\n```\n\nGraph the Gender variable individually\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nGogglesGender <- goggles %>%\n  group_by(Gender) %>%\n  summarize(n = n(),\n            mean = mean(Attractiveness),\n            sd = sd(Attractiveness),\n            se = sd/sqrt(n),\n            ci = qt(0.975, df = n - 1) * sd / sqrt(n))\n```\n\nGraph it\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nggplot(GogglesGender, aes(x = Gender,\n                           y = mean)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin  =mean -

1) * sd / sqrt(n))\n```\n\nCheck it\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nGogglesDescriptives\n```\n\nUse a line graph to graph the relationship\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nggplot(GogglesDescriptives, aes(x = Alcohol,\n                     y = mean, \n                     group=Gender, \n                     color=Gender)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin  =mean - ci, \n                    ymax = mean + ci), \n                width = .1)\n```\n\nUse dodge functions to make graph clearer\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\npd <- position_dodge(0.2)\nggplot(GogglesDescriptives, \n       aes(x = Alcohol, \n           y = mean, \n           group=Gender, \n           color=Gender)) +\n  geom_point(position = pd, \n             size = 3) +\n  geom_line(position = pd,\n            size = 1) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean -

This difference, 21.88, 95% CI\\[8.27, 35.48\\] was significant with an adjusted p = .0003.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n## Two-Way ANOVA\n\n*Before starting this section please review the section One-Way ANOVA first*\n\n### Revisiting One-Way ANOVA\n\nOne-way ANOVA is based on the general idea that the total variability $SS_T$ is partitioned (divided or separated) into two types of variability.
