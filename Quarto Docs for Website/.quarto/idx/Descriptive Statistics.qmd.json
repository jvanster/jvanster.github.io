There are several different types of datasets that can be imported. The ones used most frequently in this course are from Excel and SPSS. Types of computer files are indicated by what follows the period (\".\") in the file name. For example file.docx is a type of word file.\n\nHere's a list of common file types we'll use.\n\n-   Excel = .xlsx\n-   SPSS = .sav\n-   Comma Seperated Values = .csv\n\nOne files we'll be using today is the *Album Sales* file. On the moodle page for the course at the very top underneath the link for zoom sessions, you'll see a folder with SPSS Data Sets. When you click on the folder you'll see a list of datasets. Click on the one that says, \"Album Sales.sav\" and download it to your computer.\n\nOnce the file is downloaded go to the upper right pane in R Studio. Under the environment tab you'll see a button that says \"Import Dataset\". Click on the button and you'll get several different options. Go to the one that says \"From SPSS\" and click on it. At the top of the window you'll need to find the file you are importing to open it. Click on the Browse buttom to find the file. Once you find it click open and it will give you a preview of the file in the window. Then all you need to do is click import.\n\nHere is the code for importing the file\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nlibrary(haven)\nAlbum_Sales <- read_sav(\"Album Sales.sav\")\n```\n\n## Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statisitics are just what the name implies, they are used to *describe* a dataset. This is different from *inferential* statistics, which are used to *infer* population paramenters based on a sample.\n\nOne of the most common sets of descriptive statistics is known as *central tendency*, which is simply finding a way to get a basic overview of a dataset as a whole.\n\n### Mean\n\nThe easiest way to measure central tendency is to find the average or the *mean*. The formula for the mean is very straightforward. It's simply the sum of all the scores divided by the number of scores. The symbol for the sample mean is an x with a bar over it. $$\n\\bar X=\\frac{\\Sigma X}{N}\n$$ The capital Greek letter Sigma in the numerator stands for sum and X stands in for all the values in a dataset with the N standing for the number of values in the dataset. In R Studio, we simply use the mean command to find the mean for a particular variable\n\n```{r, eval= TRUE}\nmean(diamonds$carat)\n```\n\n### Median and Mode\n\nThere are two other measures of central tendency that are often used in statistics, *median* and *mode*. The median is simply the center score, so to find it, you simply rank order your values from lowest to highest and the middle score in that rank order. For even scores you take the two middle scores add them and divide them by two. For odd scores there is only one middle score. Here again, R gives us an easy way to find the median.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nmedian(diamonds$carat)\n```\n\nThe mode is the score or value with the highest frequency in your dataset. So whatever value occurs the most times is the mode. For some reason, mode is not part of the basic R package, so you need to install the \"modeest\" package if you need to find this descriptive statistic.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nlibrary(modeest)\n```\n\nOnce the library is installed use the mfv command\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nmfv(diamonds$carat)\n```\n\nWe tend to use the mean most often for central tendency, but it's more effected by extreme scores. So if you have several low or high outliers (extreme scores that are higher or lower than the mean), the median may be a more accurate representation of the data. More often then not, we'll use the mean. The mode is a more straightforward measure. So if you were interested in the most popular song on an album based on downloads, you would find the mode. The mode is often very helpful with categorical data.\n\n## Variability\n\nThe second most important aspect of descriptive statistics is *variability* or *dispersion* in a dataset. This typically represents how the rest of the dataset relates to the mean or some other measure of central tendency. For example: are the scores close to or widely dispersed from the mean?\n\n### Standard Deviation\n\nOften times were interested in the average spread or deviation from the mean. *Deviance* is the distance from any particular score from the mean. So to find the deviance you simply take the score and subtract it from the mean. $$\ndeviance = X - \\bar X\n$$ If we wanted to find out the total amount of deviance, we could simply add together the total deviance for each number in our dataset. So the equation would look like this: $$\ntotal\\;deviance = \\Sigma(X-\\bar X)\n$$ Unfortunately this equation causes some problems. If you remember, the mean is the average score, so it's the score at around 50%. But that means that for any dataset about half the scores will be above the mean and half the scores will be below the mean. Or another way to think about it, half the deviation scores will be negative and half the deviation scores will be positive. So if we add up all these scores, the total deviation will be equal to 0, but 0 doesn't tell us much about the spread of the scores.\n\nThe way to overcome this problem is by squaring each deviation score, which makes all the deviation values positive and thus produces a positive number. This number is called the *sum of squared errors* of the *sum of squares* (SS) with the following formula. $$\nsum\\;of\\;squares (SS) = \\Sigma(X-\\bar X)^2\n$$ This number is still somewhat inflated, since its constructed based on squared values. One way to fix this issue to to find the average dispersion, which will be based on the number in our sample. Since the sample is an estimate of the population, we actually don't use N, but N -1. This number is called *variance* and has the following symbol and equation. $$\nvariance(s^2) = \\frac {SS}{N-1} = \\frac {\\Sigma(X-\\bar X)^2}{N-1}\n$$\n\nThis number is closer to the original units of measurement, but to make it more accurate, the original squared values need to be taken back out of the measure. To do this, the square root of the variance is calculated.\n\n$$\ns = \\sqrt {\\frac {\\Sigma (X- \\bar X)^2}{N-1}}\n$$\n\nTo find the standard deviation using R Studio we use the `sd` command to find it.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nsd(Album_Sales$Adverts)\n```\n\n### Range\n\nAnother measure of dispersion is range. This is simply subtracting the highest score from the lowest score for a particular variable or vector of scores. So to find the range simply use the `range` function and then subtract the two numbers provided, which are the highest and the lowest.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nrange(Album_Sales$Adverts)\n```\n\nThen simply subtract the scores\n\n```{r}\n2271.860-9.104\n```\n\n### Interquartile Range\n\nAnother helpful type of range is the *interquartile range*, which is the range of numbers from the 25th and 75th percentile. Percentiles are just dividing up a dataset based on where certain scores are based on percentages. For example, we can look at what score is at the 50th percentile. To do that we use the `quantile` function (a *quantile* is the same thing as a *percentile*). x is the variable we are analyzing, and .5 is the percentile (.5 = 50%; .35 = 35%)\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nquantile(x = diamonds$carat, probs = .5)\n```\n\nSo the number at the 50th percentile is 0.7. Notice that this is the same as the median, described earlier. Remember that the median is the number from the dataset that is in the middle or center of the dataset. Because the mean is calculated, it may or may not be a number in the dataset. The mean is the number that describes the closest number to the average, but may or may not be a number contained in the dataset.\n\nSo to find the interquartile range, we want our two quartiles or numbers at \"quarters\" of the dataset, so 25% and 75%. Think of a dollar, which is made up of 4 quarters. We already know that half a dolar is 50 cents, which would be the median, but the other two quartiles (quarters) would be 25 cents and 75 cents.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE}\nquantile(x = diamonds$carat, probs = c(.25, .75))\n```\n\nFinally, to get the interquartile ranks we simply subtract these two numbers.\n\n```{r eval=TRUE}\n1.04-.40\n```\n\nSo the interquartile range is 0.64.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo =TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(modeest)\ndata(diamonds)\ndata(Album_Sales)\n```\n\n## Opening datasets\n\nSometimes pre-existing datasets are imported into R Studio.
