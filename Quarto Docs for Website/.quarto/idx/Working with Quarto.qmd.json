Here is how to set it up.\n\n## 1. Write your YAML file\n\nThis is just the title of the assignment and your name, date, and the output, which will be a word document. This is always at the top of any Quarto document.\n\n## 2. Add the r setup file\n\nThe r setup file lets you add any libraries or datasets you may need for the file. For example, you'll need to usually add the *tidyverse* library for most of the assignments.\n\nYou'll also need to add any datasets you are working with that you need to import. For example, to add SPSS files like the `Album Sales` Dataset you'll need to add the `haven` library and then include the code to import the file.\n\nOr if you import a .csv file, you'll need to include the code for that as well.\n\nIf you're not sure of where the file is, you can always import the file first and the copy the code from your console. Typically this is not included (include = FALSE), but sometimes we need to see how you set things up.\n\n## 3. Add questions from the assignment.\n\nFor each question you'll want to copy and paste the question from your homework into R Markdown.\n\n## 4. Answer the question\n\nQuarto allows you to answer the question using both the code and output. So I'll start with a descriptive sentence or annotation about what I'm doing and then show the code and the output.\n\nFilter dataset to mass below 250\n\n```{r}\nSmaller_StarWars <- starwars |>\n  filter(starwars$mass < 250)\nSmaller_StarWars\n```\n\nCreate a scatterplot of mass and height\n\n```{r include=TRUE}\nggplot(data = Smaller_StarWars) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mass, \n                           y = height))\n```\n\n## 5 Render your document\n\nAfter your done with your document and want to turn it in, you'll click the `render` button and it will open as a word document.\n\nThe document will be saved in your working directory. The working directory is the file where all your current files are being saved. It should be listed in your console or you can type the command `getwd()` to find it as well.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, include=FALSE}\n#Label - include all your packages here\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n\n# Quarto\n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a document format in R Studio that allows you to print off your notes, homework, and code as a word doc or other types of files.
