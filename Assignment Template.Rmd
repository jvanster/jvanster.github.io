# Add Questions from homework

1.  Create a data set of the total number of Covid cases in 5 counties in California.

```{r}
Total_Cases <- tribble(~County, ~Cases, 
                       "Los Angeles", 2730000, 
                       "Fresno", 233000, 
                       "Stanislaus", 129000,
                       "Tulare", 124000, 
                       "San Diego", 750000)
Total_Cases
```

*(Write a summary statement or add any other details if necessary)*

4.  Create a bar graph based on the Covid cases by county dataset you just created.

```{r, include=TRUE}
ggplot(data = Total_Cases) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = County, y = Cases), 
           stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Cases by County in California")
```
