# Notes from the presentation
R Markdown is a document format based on the R language and Markdown to intermingle computing with narratives in the same document. With this simple format, you can actually do a lot of things. For example, you can generate reports dynamically (no need to cut-and-paste any results because all results can be dynamically generated from R), write papers and books, create websites, and make presentations. In this talk, I'll use a single R Markdown document to give demos of the R packages rmarkdown,

- bookdown for authoring books (https://bookdown.org),
- blogdown for creating websites (https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown),
- rticles for writing journal papers (https://github.com/rstudio/rticles),
- xaringan for making slides (https://github.com/yihui/xaringan),
- flexdashboard for generating dashboards (https://github.com/rstudio/flexdashboard),
- learnr for tutorials (https://github.com/rstudio/learnr),
- rolldown for storytelling (https://github.com/yihui/rolldown),

And the integration between Shiny and R Markdown. To make the best use of your time during the presentation, I recommend you to take a look at the rmarkdown website in advance: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.
